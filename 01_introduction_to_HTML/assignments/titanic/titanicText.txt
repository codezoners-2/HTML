RMS Titanic

Introduction

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic 
Ocean in the early morning of 15th April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg 
during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US.
The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of more than 1,500 people 
in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. 
The RMS Titanic, the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service, 
was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White 
Star Line, and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast 
with Thomas Andrews as her naval architect. Andrews was among those lost 
in the sinking. On her maiden voyage, she carried 2,224 passengers and crew.

Passengers

Under the command of Edward Smith, the ship's passengers included some of the 
wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain 
and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North 
America. A wireless telegraph was provided for the convenience of passengers as well 
as for operational use. Although Titanic had advanced safety features such as 
watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, there were not 
enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard due to outdated maritime safety 
regulations. Titanic only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people, slightly more than 
half of the number on board, and one-third her total capacity.
