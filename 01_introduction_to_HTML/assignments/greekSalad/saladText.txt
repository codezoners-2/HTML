Ingredients
-------------
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
4 whole ripe tomatoes, cut into 6 wedges
1 whole cucumber cut into fourths lengthwise
1/2 whole red onion, sliced very thin
30 whole pitted kalamata olives
6 ounces crumbled feta cheese
Fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Steps
-----
Add the chopped lettuce, tomato wedges, cucumber chunks, onion slices, halved olives, half the feta and some parsley to a large bowl.

Combine the olive oil, vinegar, sugar, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper and chopped olives in a bowl or mason jar. Whisk or shake together until combined. Taste and adjust seasonings (I almost always add a little more sugar).

Pour the dressing over the salad ingredients, then add some salt and pepper. Toss with tongs or clean hands. Just before serving, top with the remaining feta and squeeze a little lemon juice over the top.
