# Superhero Login

Modify the template in the previous exercise to show a special welcome page for superheroes.

For most users, there will be no difference: they'll see a welcome message with their own name.

For superheroes who log in with their "everyday" names, they'll be welcomed by their codenames instead.

(This requires more use of `if` ... `else` ... `endif` statements.)

Choose your own superheroes...! But support more than one.

## Bonus Exercise

Superheroes need to protect their identity, so they don't have the same password (`user`) as normal folks. Instead, they all share the password `super`. Can you implement this?
