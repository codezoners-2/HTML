# Forms: More Fun with Flags

## Flags from Swatches

Can you modify your flag-generating form to use the swatch-style `INPUT TYPE="COLOR"` tags?

## Validation

Can you make the country name obligatory, using `REQUIRED`? How about adding a `PLACEHOLDER` to add some prompt text to the input field?

## Hidden Fields

We can use inputs with `TYPE="HIDDEN"` to post parameters which aren't seen on screen. Can you use these to create a page with a button for each of the following countries:

- Germany
- France
- Armenia
- Austria
- Ireland

With all these exercises, as before, post to `http://bakirkoy.cassiel.com:8080/flag/`.
