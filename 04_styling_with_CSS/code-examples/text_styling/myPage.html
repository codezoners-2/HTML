		 <h1>Richard Stallman</h1>
		 
		 <div class="section">
			 <h2>Introduction</h2>
			 <p>Stallman is a software freedom activist and computer programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. He is best known for launching the GNU Project, founding the Free Software Foundation, developing the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and writing the GNU General Public License.</p>

			 <h2>Early Life</h2>
			 <p>Stallman was born to Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker in 1953 in New York City. He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094. From 1967â€“1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students. Stallman was also a volunteer laboratory assistant in the biology department at Rockefeller University. Although he was interested in mathematics and physics, his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist.</p>

			 <h2>GNU Project</h2>
			 <p>Stallman announced the plan for the GNU operating system in September 1983 on several ARPANET mailing lists and USENET. Stallman started the project on his own and describes: "As an operating system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it."</p>
