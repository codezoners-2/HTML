# pH scale with boxes

Modify the myStyle.css file from the previous exercise to make the table look like the pH_scale_boxes.png image below.

# make sure your css file include the following:
1. 20px padding for all your entries defined in the body section
2. all of the content (body) should take 50% of the page and scale accordingly.
3. it should nevertheless have a minimum width of 300px. (ie. by resizing the window the content should be less than 300px.
4. the content should be centered on the page and have a top margin of 100px.
5. the header should inherit the padding from the body and it should have a black solid border, 10px wide.
6. paragraphs should only have 10px padding, have a border radius of 20px and a top margin of 10px
