# TextFun with Richard Stallman.

## Make the page look like the on in textFun.png

Change the myPage.html file and create a .css file called myStyle.css and follow these steps:

1. set the padding of the body to 20px
2. the default font-weight for all headers and links is bold, so reset that for all headers + links to normal and set the color for all of them to rgb(0,136,221) and their margin to 0px.
3. header 1: should be using the "Georgia" font, the size should be 250% greater than normal, and it should have 10px padding at the bottom. As a challege lookup also how to add shadow to text. You'll need to use the text-shadow command. Set the v=2px h=2px and the blur to 3px. Se the shadow color to rgb(50,50,50).
4. header 2: should use the Arial font, the size should be 90% and should convert all text to uppercase no matter what case it is originally. Set letter spacing to 3px.
5. header 3: should be 150%
6. paragraphs should use teh Arial font and you should use a nice brown like this rgb(102,85,68).
7. the sentence "Richard Stallman is a .... programmer." should be of class "intro" in the html file and the css should turn all paragraphs of type intro to bold.
8. the string "from wikipedia" should be of class "source" and in the css set to italic and aligned right.
9. the links should have no decoration unless one hovers over them when they become underlined.
