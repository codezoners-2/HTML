# Tour of Silicon Valley + CSS

### Modify the tourOfSiliconValley.html file in order to make it look like the siliconValleyCSS.png image. Make sure you have the following features:
1. Create a myStyle.css file and have the html file point to it.
2. Define the background of the entire page as grey.
3. The default font (defined in the body) should be Arial and it should be white.
4. The width of the page should be 920px and no less than 500px.
5. Make sure the page is centered.
6. Give the level 1 heading a background blue color 0,0,100, add padding of 20px, give it a border radius of 30px and set the border as 4px. Center the text.
7. Give the level 2 header a background color of 40,40,180 add padding of 5px, use Times font as well as the same border characteristics as level 1 headings.
8. Make the bullet of the unordered list a square.
9. Create a class "address" for all address paragraphs, setting the font to courier and to italic.
10. Enclose each destination idea in a div of class "highlight". Set the font color to black, background color to 130, 110, 230, give it a bottom margin of 20px, and a left margin of 10px, a bottom-padding of 20px, left padding of 10px and a border radius of 30px. Set the highlight div to float: left. What should the width of each highlight div be? Do the math! You'll need the trick with the "clear" command. Hint: you can use more than one class for elements as long as you separate them by commas.
11. Give the fonts of level 3 heading a black color and a padding of 10px.
12. Make the links be white, blue when they have been visited and red when you hover over them.
