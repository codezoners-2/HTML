It’s a mechanical computer that allows you to pull out a slide which contains an “if, then, else” statement (“If this slide is out, open this track, else train crashes”). The tower and its' interlocking machine were used around the clock from 1927 when it was first put into operation until July 17, 1993. You can visit it, if you get a member of the South Bay Historical Railroad society to open it up for you.</p>
