# starter-template

This is Bootstrap's starting template. In its current form, it won't work. (It will load, but will look rather basic, and the console in Firefox or Chrome will report "file not found" errors.) Can you fix the links in the body of the HTML page to make it render properly?

(You'll need to install Bootstrap somewhere locally, or - better - use links to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) copy of it.)
