# Building Sites with Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a framework for building responsive, resizeable web sites. It's a combination of CSS (for styling) and Javascript (for interaction). It's a *front-end framework*: all the work is done in the browser (rather than the server).

## Features

- Layout template: a grid-based layout system.

- Navigation: a standard set of tools for building navigation components.

- HTML components (buttons, drop-down menus, tabs, ...).

- Javascript components: dialog boxes, tooltips, ...

- Responsiveness: pages are dynamically adapted for various screen sizes (from desktop to mobile).
